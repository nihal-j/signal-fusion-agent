For a high-stakes voice agent project like Mosaic Aegis, you need a stack that prioritizes low-latency audio, secure orchestration, and dynamic capability discovery.🛠️ The Comprehensive Tech StackLayerTechnologyPurposeInterfaceApple App Intents / Siri ShortcutsCaptures "Hey Siri" triggers and forwards GPS, Time, and On-Device Context to your backend.Voice EngineAzure AI Speech Voice LiveHandles bidirectional, full-duplex audio. Includes Semantic VAD to detect when a user finishes speaking or interrupts.BackendPython 3.13 + FastAPIThe "Central Nervous System." Asynchronous architecture is required to handle concurrent voice and tool-calling streams.OrchestrationDedalus Labs SDKUnified gateway for models (GPT-4o/Claude) and Zero-Trust tool management.Tool ProtocolModel Context Protocol (MCP)Standardized "plug-and-play" interface for the agent to interact with local and remote services.DiscoveryAwesome-MCP Registry APIThe "App Store" for your agent, allowing it to autonomously find and load new capabilities.State & MemoryRedisStores real-time session state and VAD flags for ultra-low latency response.PersistenceTimescaleDB & ChromaDBTimescale stores interaction logs; Chroma provides RAG-based memory for user preferences.InfrastructureDocker & uvDocker sandboxes third-party tools; uv provides the fastest dependency resolution for dynamic tool loading.🏗️ Implementation Overview1. The Real-Time Voice BridgeUsing FastAPI with Azure Voice Live allows you to process audio in real-time. Instead of waiting for a full recording, the agent hears and begins "thinking" as the user speaks.Key Feature: Semantic VAD ensures the agent doesn't talk over you but responds the millisecond you're done.2. The Dedalus Secure VaultThis is your security backbone. When the agent needs to book an Uber or send an email, the Dedalus Gateway intercepts the call.Mechanism: It injects your local API keys into the request at the proxy level. The LLM sees the result but never sees your raw credentials.3. Dynamic MCP DiscoveryThis is the "Self-Improving" layer. If you ask for a feature the agent doesn't have:Search: It queries the Awesome-MCP Registry.Match: It identifies a compatible server (e.g., Spotify or Google Maps).Deploy: It uses uvx to spin up that tool in an isolated container and updates its own capabilities on-the-fly.4. Contextual RAG MemoryEvery interaction is embedded into ChromaDB.Outcome: The agent remembers you prefer "Window seats" or "No cilantro" without you needing to repeat yourself in future sessions.
